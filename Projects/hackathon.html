<p><strong>Coding projects</strong> can take a <em>long</em> time. Partly because programmers can only type so fast, and partly because of the innate perfectionism that comes attached to the job.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing… Hackathons</strong></p>
<p>Hackathons are basically time-based contests where contestants are given a set amount of time to build an app, game, or website.</p>
<p>My friend and I participated in the July 2022 Recess Hackathon, and as a pair, our project won the popular vote!</p>
<p>We created “Quibble” a platform that theoretically connects online buyers to online sellers. The problem that we wanted to solve is the fact that sometimes sellers don’t know how much something in their garage is worth. This is where Quibble comes in: to allow the buyer and seller to reach a mutual deal.</p>
