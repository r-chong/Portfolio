<h1 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Ask-me-anything interview chatbot!</p>
<p>This is a custom chatbot buit on GPT-3.5 that is designed to answer questions on my behalf and provide a modern version of a bio. Ask any question about me, and the AI Assistant will answer, in real time!</p>
<h1 id="the-journey-of-gpt-interview-bot">The Journey of GPT-Interview-Bot</h1>
<p>ChatGPT has taken the world by storm over the last six months of its beta release. As an aspiring young developer, naturally I wanted to try my hand at making something with this cool new piece of tech while it was still relevant! At the same time, I had started preparing for the RBC Summer Tech Labs position, with applications opening up a few months away. Thinking ahead, I knew that I would need to make a portfolio website. Of course, I wanted some way to make it unique, because if you know anything about me, I will not settle for the default 😄. Thus came my idea: What if, instead of having a static webpage talking about myself, viewers could just ASK me? Before, I would have had to sit at my computer and answer each and every question, but with AI, this could now be automated.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, I brainstormed how I could accomplish this. ChatGPT is very interesting in that everyone knows how to use it, but hardly anyone knows how it works internally. I had to learn a ton about tokenization, API calling, and whether or not I would need to build my own AI model. Thankfully, I stumbled upon a video from Hugging Face AI, talking about “pre-prompting” and how you could give the AI context through system messages. This revolutionized everything. I wouldn’t need to train my computer on a bazillion different questions about myself, I could use OpenAI’s base product, which is DaVinci 003, and build upon it with futher pre-prompting.</p>

<p>The chatbot is built using the GPT-3 language model by OpenAI. When a user asks a question, the chatbot processes the message, and adds on a custom “pre-prompted” message that I have programmed into the API request (see <code>apiRequestBody</code>), and generates a response that is displayed in the chat window. There were some hiccups along the way, but I am proud to say that this was my first app created using the GPT API and I plan for many more to come.</p>
<p>To make the chatbot more interactive and engaging, I’ve added various features such as icons, typing indicators, and animations. These features help to create a more natural and conversational experience for the user.</p>

<p>In the near future, I plan to embed this pr<code>enter code here</code>oof-of-concept into my future portfolio site and upgrade the AI model to GPT-4.</p>
